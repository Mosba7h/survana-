# Sentiment Analysis for Technology Survival

## Project Overview

This repository contains the code and resources for a sentiment analysis project aimed at determining the potential survival of new technologies. The project is part of a larger survival analysis initiative that utilizes feedback from social media and tech news. The sentiment analysis incorporates data from three distinct types: text, audio, and video, each analyzed using specialized models.

### Objectives
- **Text Data**: Analyze textual feedback using BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) to understand sentiment trends.
- **Video Data**: Evaluate video content using SVM (Support Vector Machine) combined with HOG (Histogram of Oriented Gradients) features and facial landmarks to gauge visual sentiment.
- **Audio Data**: Process and analyze audio feedback with CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) to assess auditory sentiment.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementing models and data processing.
- **PyTorch**: Framework for building and training neural network models.
- **Huggingface Transformers**: Library for state-of-the-art NLP models, including BERT.
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis tool.
- **Seaborn**: Data visualization library based on Matplotlib.
- **Matplotlib**: Library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations.
- **Scikit-learn**: Machine learning library for model training and evaluation.
- **OpenCV**: Library for computer vision tasks.
- **Mediapipe**: Library for real-time face and hand tracking.
- **Joblib**: Library for serializing Python objects, used for model saving and loading.
- **Scikit-image**: Library for image processing.
- **Pytube**: Library for downloading videos from YouTube.
